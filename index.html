							<h2>About Us</h2>
							<p>
								The <strong>Cloud Transparency Initiative</strong> is a product of the
								University of Washington's iSchool Capstone Program, created by students
								Jordan&nbsp;Atwood and Doug&nbsp;Wynkoop.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>
								Company networks stand to benefit greatly through cloud service adoption, but
								improperly-chosen or ill-established cloud services can be insecure or unstable.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<h2>Our Solution</h2>
							<p>
								For lack of a centralized reference or resource, we created this website to highlight
								key concerns and address anticipated problems when considering cloud solutions.

				<h1 class="page-header text-primary-dark">Threats & Solutions</h1>
				<p class="lead">
					In securing any network, there are a number of attack surfaces which must be considered.
				</p>
				<p>We will cover issues pertaining to these three main surfaces:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Local Network</dt>
					<dd>
						Threats which concern the physical network owned by the company itself,
						particularly relevant if no cloud solution is utilized.
					</dd>
					<dt>Cloud Network</dt>
					<dd>
						Issues regarding communication between the company's network and the cloud
						provider's network, as well as concerns regarding the security and integrity
						of the provider's network.
					</dd>
					<dt>Legal & Compliance</dt>
					<dd>
						There are a wide variety of compliance and regulatory rules that can affect
						the administration of a network and its security.
					</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
					<strong>A final note before diving into each surface:</strong> while verifying that these issues
					are resolved, being able to trust your network provider (cloud or otherwise) is
					vitally important. They will be handling all of your data, and should thus be
					responsible for its safety and protection. That, above all else, should be prioritized.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2 class="text-primary-dark" id="network-issues">Network</h2>
				<h3 id="network-unsecured-ports">Unsecured Ports</h3>
				<p>
					Network communication occurs by sending information through a specific pathway to
					a computer. These pathways are called <strong>ports</strong>, and should be taken
					into consideration when securing a network from outside traffic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Computers have thousands of ports, most of which are assigned to traffic for a
					particular application. Other ports, on the other hand, are used for specific network
					protocols, and only certain types of data are expected to travel through them.
				</p>
				<h4>Securing Ports</h4>
				<p>
					Because most ordinary network traffic will be carried out by a core set of applications
					(web browsers, file management clients, or proprietary software), it is typically
					wise to disallow traffic which attempts to communicate over ports which are not
					used by those applications &mdash; that is, to whitelist safe traffic, blocking all other
					traffic. The port used for a given application can be found using a network traffic
					analyzer or by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">referencing
					a list of port numbers</a>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="network-enabled-services">Enabled Services</h3>
				<p>
					In the same vein as <a href="#unsecured-ports">unsecured ports</a>, computer systems
					will typically come installed with a suite of applications of various uses &mdash; productivity
					software, system management, and more. Because these applications are already installed
					on the system, a malicious outsider would only need to gain access to one which could
					significantly damage or compromise a system rather than attempt to install malware or
					other invasive programs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately, mitigating the risk of enabled services is as simple as uninstalling
					programs and services which are not used, and limiting the use of those which are
					installed by use of user management, or some other permissions system.
				</p>
				<h3 id="network-man-in-the-middle">Man-in-the-middle Attacks</h3>
				<p>
					Man-in-the-middle attacks are attempts to listen in on, or interrupt network traffic
					in transit, and are typically carried out over wireless mediums, as traffic is sent
					over the air, rather than directly from peer to peer. Such attacks aim to glean sensitive
					information as it is sent over the network, such as passwords, personal information,
					and financial information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because these types of attacks rely on receiving data which is human-readable, the
					primary method to combat them is to encrypt <em>all</em> network traffic in transit.
					This will mean that websites will be served over <code>https</code> (HTTP network traffic
					on top of an SSL or TLS protocol) or some other secure protocol. Any implementation
					of this type of encryption should be applied to <strong>all pages of a website</strong>
					in order to prevent any would-be attackers from stealing a logged-in user's session
					ID and using it to log into that website as the victim.
				</p>
				<h3 id="network-insider-threat">Insider Threat</h3>
				<p>
					While various company members may have reason to need access to a wide variety of
					network resources, it is in the best interest of security not to allow all employees
					universal permissions. Instead, permissions should be given to groups, and users assigned
					to the group which fits their needs. That way, a malicious insider would have significantly
					limited access compared to a universal "all-access-granted" permissions system.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2 class="text-primary-dark" id="cloud-issues">Cloud</h2>
				<h3 id="cloud-data-storage">Data Storage</h3>
				<p>
					When storing information in the cloud, there are a number of issues which present
					themselves in <em>how</em> the data is stored. Regarding storage, data in the cloud
					should <strong>always</strong> be encrypted so that it cannot be deciphered if stolen
					or hijacked.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beyond physical protections, cloud providers should additionally provide assurances
					which protect data from themselves. For instance, data uploaded to the cloud should
					not be used by the provider for data analysis, and should be safe from insider access.
					Furthermore, data which is deleted or data which was stored on equipment removed from
					the cloud environment should not remain in memory or on disk &mdash; it should be permanently
					and irreversibly purged from the cloud system. (except in special cases, see
					<a href="#compliance-ediscovery">eDiscovery</a>)
				</p>
				<h3 id="cloud-data-recover-and-data-loss">Data Recovery and Data Loss</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to ensuring cloud data is encrypted (thus protected from data theft),
					data stored on the cloud should also be redundant and accessible or should otherwise
					be able to be recovered in the case of accident or equipment failure.
				</p>
				<h3 id="cloud-network-visibility">Network Visibility</h3>
				<p>
					Cloud networks are comprised of a variable number of physical or virtual machines
					all cooperating, in a sense, to store and compute data. Because of this, they are
					significantly more complex than a traditional physical network and may have exposed
					vulnerabilities due to misconfigured or improperly-installed machines. As such, cloud
					providers should be proactive regarding these issues and forthcoming about measures
					they take to combat them.
				</p>
				<h3 id="cloud-governance">Governance</h3>
				<p>
					Data storage is a practice which has a number of laws written regarding how and where
					it can be stored, who can access it, etc. In addition, these laws are not identical
					between states and countries. As such, cloud providers should not withhold data center
					locations, and should make clear any implications which come with data being stored
					at a particular location.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2 class="text-primary-dark" id="compliance-issues">Compliance</h2>
				<h3 id="compliance-pci-dss">PCI DSS</h3>
				<p>
					PCI DSS is the industry standard for storage and use of credit card-related information.
					Violation can result in fines and/or get a company suspended from accepting credit
					cards for payment. When dealing with any cloud provider, the requirements to meet
					these standards are less clear, and should be explicitly discussed to avoid confusion.
				</p>
				<p>
					While each company may have its own standards, there are 12 major stipulations they
					require:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Build and Maintain a Secure Network</li>
					<li>Change Vendor Defaults</li>
					<li>Protect Data</li>
					<li>Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data</li>
					<li>Use and Regularly Update Anti-Virus Software</li>
					<li>Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications</li>
					<li>Restrict Access to Cardholder Data</li>
					<li>Assign a Unique ID to Each Person with Computer Access</li>
					<li>Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data</li>
					<li>Track and Monitor All Access to Network Resources and Cardholder Data</li>
					<li>Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes</li>
					<li>Maintain a Policy that Addresses Information Security for all Personnel</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="compliance-ediscovery">eDiscovery</h3>
				<p>
					eDiscovery is the legal requirement that a company provide electronic information
					during an inspection or civil suit, and is in place to provide a method that an entity
					can use to prove that they have been acting in good faith and following data storage
					and protection laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					eDiscovery typically will require three things of organizations: <strong>an audit
					trail</strong>, <strong>information preservation</strong> &mdash; that stored data
					be preserved for a certain amount of time before it may be deleted, and <strong>organization
					and metadata</strong> &mdash; information regarding the category, location, network
					backups, and more of specific data.
				</p>
				<h3 id="sarbanes-oxley">Sarbanes-Oxley</h3>
				<p>
					Sarbanes-Oxley laws require that companies be responsible for financial data and
					records, and must provide documentation that they are sufficiently protecting them,
					such as:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Security Policies</dt>
					<dd>
						Companies must provide documentation on all policies designed to keep their network safe.
					</dd>
					<dt>Meeting Industry Benchmarks</dt>
					<dd>

						<ul>
							<li>Workstation and server configuration</li>
							<li>Physical security</li>
							<li>Network infrastructure administration</li>
							<li>System access controls</li>
							<li>Data classification and management</li>
							<li>Application development and management</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>IAAA</dt>
					<dd>
						Companies must prove that they are providing adequate <em>Identification</em>,
						<em>Authentication</em>, <em>Authorization</em>, and <em>Account management</em>.
					</dd>
					<dt>Network Security</dt>
					<dd>
						Companies must prove they are taking adequate care of their networks, utilizing
						a good network perimeter, encryption, antivirus, and strong wireless security.
					</dd>
					<dt>Monitoring</dt>
					<dd>
						Networks must be able to be monitored.
					</dd>
					<dt>Segregation of Duties</dt>
					<dd>
						Network employees must have segregated duties, and with them, segregated permissions.
					</dd>
					<dt>Physical Security</dt>
					<dd>
						Cloud providers' data centers must be highly physically secure as to prevent
						physical data breach.
					</dd>
